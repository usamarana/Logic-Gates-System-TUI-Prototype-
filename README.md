# Logic-Gates-System-TUI-Prototype-
A functional logic gate system using AND/OR gates to make various connections to the bulb. This project was demonstrated in a form of circuit system so that the audience have a better understanding of how logic gates work by interacting with it physically via the Tangible User Interface (TUI), instead of just reading the table.

**NOTE:** 
As shown in the image above there are many possible complex connections which can be made with this system with the combination of both gates (functional). However this video only shows a quick demo of simple connections.
